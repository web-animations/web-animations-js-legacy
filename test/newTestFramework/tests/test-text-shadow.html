<div> There is a issues with reading color as it can be displayed from css as
      a color name, rgb or rgba. Trying to find a good (doesn't include
      special cases) solution atm. <br>
      Also auto mode is picking up a bug manual currently doesn't see which is
      the begining of the animation is open instead of closed.

// The quick solution is to pass in rgba instead of color name
