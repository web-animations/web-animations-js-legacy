  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 1 - Make a Parallel Group</div>

  <p class="description">Groupings are important so let's 
  get started on the exercise</p>

  <p class="description">In this exercise, create a parallel group 
  of animation that has 3 different animations. Each children should run 300px, 
  500px, 700px from top respectively for 5 seconds.</p>

  <p class="description">Hint: you should first create the children then 
  include the children into the group. You might also need to create 
  more animation divs in the html section and change their colour 
  depends on your preferences.</p>
